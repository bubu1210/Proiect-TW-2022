      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Sa se implementeze o aplicatie Web ce permite utilizatorilor autentificati gestiunea de autografe
        ale unor personalitati (din domenii precum cultura, sport, politica, stiinta), inclusiv contextul
        obtinerii autografului: moment de tip (i.e. concert, dineu, intalnire intamplatoare), locatie
        geografica, obiectul pe care a fost plasat (afis, carte, minge, tricou,...), mentiuni speciale
        (i.e. "a nu se expune in mediu umed deoarece a fost scris cu cerneala", "are atasata o dedicatie
        speciala", "include un desen"). Fiecare autograf va avea asociate seturi de termeni de continut
        (tag-uri) pentru a facilita regasirea. De asemenea, vor putea fi specificate cotatii vizand
        valoarea unui autograf, plus schimburi (N autografe ale artistului A echivalente cu M autografe
        ale savantului S). Rapoartele despre colectiile de autografe si clasamentele pe categorii
        (e.g., cele mai multe autografe oferite de personalitatea P din domeniul D) vor fi disponibile
        si in formatele RSS, CSV si PDF.
      </p>

      <p>
        AuCo is a web application that allows its users to share, manage or exchange their autographs,
        see generated raports about them and compare their value.
      </p>

      <section id="authentication">
        <h3>Authentication</h3>
        <p>
          In order to use the application to the fullest, users have to log in with an account. Therefore, the first page
          they see when they access our application will be a login page. If they don't have an account,
          they can access a sign up page where an account can be created.
        </p>

        <p>
          A new account can be easily created with an e-mail address, an username and a password.
          Validations will take place once the form is submitted - both on the front-end and the
          back-end.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="home">
        <h3>Home page</h3>
        <p>
          Once logged in, the user will be redirected to the homepage, where he can preview some of the
          most recent autographs.
          Also the autographs are grouped based on the domain of the celebrity. The user can customise
          his preferences and see autographs based on his interests.
        </p>

        <p>
          From this page he can navigate the application using the top menu.
          Main functionalities are:
          <ul>
            <li>Adding an autograph</li>
            <li>Filtering autographs using the searchbar and other custom filters</li>
            <li>Customizing his profile</li>
            <li>Generating raports</li>
            <li>Viewing other users profiles</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="sharing">
        <h3>Sharing</h3>
        <p>
          In AuCo everyone can see everyone else's authographs from the main page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each autograph added must have information about the famous person to whom it belongs,
          the domain of the respective person, the context in which it was obtained, the location,
          on what it was given and other special mentions related to maintaining the autograph in
          its best condition for as long as possible (e.g. "it should be kept in a dry environment
          because it was written with ink", "it has a special dedication attached", "includes a
          drawing").
        </p>
        <p>
          To ease the search for an autograph, when added, each autograph will have associated a list
          of tags.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="design">
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>
          We tried to make our application as easy to use as possible and each feature and
          component was designed with the core functionalities in mind, making sure it is also
          intuitive to use.
        </p>

        <p>
          Starting fron the home page, a preview of the most recent autographs is displayed with a
          slider component, but we also give the possibility to access all the autographs with a simple
          click.
        </p>

        <p>
          The autographs are featured using 2 components - a simple card used in the afore mentioned slider,
          and a more detailed card shown when viewing all the autographs.
        </p>

        <p>
          The menu consists of a searchbar with an advanced search functionality, and a user info widget,
          indicating his authentication status, which, once the user is logged in, shows his avatar and
          toggles a dropdown for easy navigation to the most important pages.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the user page, a side menu is used to control and show only the relevant information for the user
          in the main view.
        </p>

        <p>
          The color theme consists of a simple pallete of black, white and several shades of grey, so we don't
          subtract from the beauty of the autographs added by our lovely users *wink* (please donate).
        </p>

        <p>
          We tried to maintain a consistent look throughout the application by using a simple design system
          just so we can reuse as much of our resources as possible. We did this by defining variables for
          our colors, fonts, background images, modularizing our stylesheets and using the same structure for
          the HTML.
        </p>

        <p>
          We implemented a responsive design by using a mobile first approach.
